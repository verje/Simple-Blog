              Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of
              the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities
              of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually
              meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is
              center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The
              airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe
              in practice, not in theory.

              Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for
              both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The
              early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

              What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man
              set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

              There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’
              Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the
              generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is
              always the thrill of just beginning.

              The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
              tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too
              much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.

            <p>
              As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
              size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
              beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object
              looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a
              finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change
              a man.
